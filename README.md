This is in **Markdown**. I can also bullet points:
- point 1
- point 2.

Can I do lists?
1. First
2. And the second.

One more change. 

Today is the 13th 15:35. I am writing this text for funsies. 

I will now try to add LaTex code. 

I guess I can type out the commands here:
    `$f(s)=\sqrt{x^2\ln x}`

What I do next is that I basically paste the picture generated from LaTex processor website. 
    `<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.image?\dpi{110}&space;f(s)=\sqrt{x^2\ln&space;x}" title="f(s)=\sqrt{x^2\ln x}" />`
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.image?\dpi{110}&space;f(s)=\sqrt{x^2\ln&space;x}" title="f(s)=\sqrt{x^2\ln x}" />

Just a comment.
